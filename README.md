## Introduction:
There are many car related and racing related Computer Graphics Capstone Projects. Some are simple, some little complex but all are good for student to choose for their Mini Project. Our CGVR Capstone Project is made in Blender which is a 3D CAD software. Blender is an open source software which means it is free to use with a wide range of add-ons available for creating a suitable environment or easily importing ready-made models from other software like Solidworks.
